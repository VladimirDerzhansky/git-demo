Baptised with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself

War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give

Caress the one, the never-fading
Rain in your heart -
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
